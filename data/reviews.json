Nooooo! \n\nIn the Cleveland area, there's an endless supply of small, unique eateries that take the time to create and serve unique, tasteful, hand-crafted items with flavor. Hot Sauce Williams has created a great commodity in his BBQ sauce, however, ruins the spirit of Cleveland goodies by serving it over generic, tasteless, frozen bag items. \n\nGranted, my review is based off a Polish Boy sandwich combo. I haven't tried anything else and after trying the combo, I most likely won't make my way back to try anything else. \n\nG Love sang about it, so it can't be that bad, can it? Can the creator of such gems as 'Cold Beverages' and 'Milk and Cereal' really steer me in the wrong direction? He did, however, I'll forgive him with a listening of 'Baby's Got Sauce' (pun intended?). \n\nThe fries are actually store-bought Ore-Ida brand fries. I can remember being served those with dinner when I was a lad in the late 1980s. They are perfectly tasteless. The sauce drenches over them, adding taste, but it just seems incredibly lazy to take something I can easily buy in the store, increase the price, and serve it to customers.  \n\nThe buns are of exactly the same nature - walk in to any grocery store and purchase the cheapest hot dog buns they have - you'd be getting exactly what is served. \n\nThe sausage wasn't bad, had some taste and was of average size (I'd throw in a 'that's what she said,' but that phrase is so overused, I'll let it be). \n\nIt isn't terrible, but to be honest, without the sauce, there's no way Hot Sauce Williams would still be in business after all these years. The cute nickname helps, I'm guessing. I'm guessing a lot of people wouldn't keep returning to a \"Mr. Williams Barbecue Restaurant\" - so I guess the gimmick is working. Plus, it'd be totally cool of Williams decided to sponsor a MMA fighter, just so there'd be a fighter with the 'Hot Sauce' nickname. \n\nThe service is, well, non-existent. I asked for 'slaw on the side, and when I received my meal, my 'slaw was in the middle, which made the bun and accompanying fries soggy on the center and sides - they fell apart upon contact. The 'slaw is mostly liquid. I was reduced to eating a weird liquid mixture of Ore-Ida fries, juicy 'slaw, BBQ sauce and bread. \n\nSort of weird, they also give out cans of soda instead of fountain drinks. \n\nI'd buy a bottle of the sauce and use that at home, but I really wouldn't suggest eating here unless you're interested in a bland, sloppy mess of stuff you can grab at the nearest Piggly Wiggly (which, for Northerners, is probably pretty far away, so I'd have no clue why you'd travel that far to grab those simple ingredients).","useful":5,"user_id":"bAwfPH4lXNzgcYp9JFy6ow"}

I have given this location two back to back chances and it was a disappointment on both occasions. \n\nThe place is defiantly a dive and not the cleanest. One our first visit on a Saturday night we ordered two 4 piece chicken dinners for my wife and I and one 2 piece chicken dinner for our daughter. We finally received our food after a 45 minute wait and the place was completely dead! The four piece chicken dinner comes with a breast, wing, thigh and drumstick, coleslaw, fries and BBQ sauce on the chicken & fries. Talk about a party in my mouth! The chicken was hot and juicy and cooked just right and seasoned to perfection! The fries and slaw were good also.\n\nThe employee's attitudes and customer service skills are in need of as much of a makeover as the dining space needs. The second time we went was the next day as we were on our way back home from Cleveland and got a 20 piece chicken to go. The girl at the cash register was on her phone the whole time I placed the order. I understand that it's a slow Sunday afternoon but, really?! She had a really foul attitude and just couldn't be bothered with taking orders. She was acting like actually pausing her phone conversation to take my order was a major inconvenience to her. \n\nIt took about 25 minutes to get our chicken the second time which is weird as I ordered a lot more chicken the second time. I would defiantly call ahead to place your order because if you wait on your food it WILL be a while.\n\nThe chicken is very good but, not worth the wait and dealing with the employee's bad attitudes.

Adam Richman was high when he said this sauce was incredible.\n\nChicken: Very good chicken, dark meat. The breading was very crispy and the meat was juicy.

Their service is very hit or miss.\n\nThough HSW is a bbq joint, I don't think it's necessarily their strongest point. The bbq sauce is really fantastic. The ribs and pulled pork are really good, but not really great. Granted, that's really comparing to at-home bbq using a smoker. When it comes to restaurants, you will be hard pressed to find better bbq in NE Ohio. And it's definitely better than other Ohio bbq chains like Carolina BBQ and City BBQ. \n\nWhere HSW really shines is their fried chicken and Po Boy and Po Girl. The fried chicken is easily some of the best fried chicken I've ever had - crisp skin, cooked to perfect doneness. But if you go to HSW, be sure to get a Po Boy or Po Girl. What's the exact difference? I don't remember. The better one is the one with a hot sausage in a bun topped with pork shoulder, french fries, coleslaw, and french fries (I think that's the po girl). I cannot eat it with my hands, because it falls apart. If you can eat it without utensils, then give yourself 100 extra Man Points (c). Unfortunately, I dont get to make it to HSW very often, so I've not been able to try their fried fish or several other foods.\n\nFor drinks, they have soda machines and HUGs (kool aid in a tiny barel). Last time I was there, they didn't have a soda machine, so no free refills, which is a bummer\n\nThough I love the food and their pink & blue color scheme outside, I think they only hire terrible people to work the registers. I've literally never eaten there and experienced a cashier that wasn't rude. They not only seemed to hate me on a personal level, but were offended by my audacity of ordering food there. With that being said, the cooks and individuals handing out the food have always been very sweet and friendly. Also, there was an employee my first visit there who helped me open a stuck bathroom door, and he was really great. I'm confused as to why the cashiers have been awful. Granted, I haven't been to HSW in well over a year since I moved out of state, so perhaps their cashiers are less butthurt now.\n\nIf I remember correctly, all locations are not places you want to be late and night by yourself with obvious fistfuls of cash (if ya catch my drift), so if you're an easily scared white person, go for lunch. Also, they used to only accept cash - not sure if that's changed.\n\nIf you're looking for a local restaurant and would like some soul food or bbq, I very highly recommend HSW. Also, the Carnegie location is right down the road from the Cleveland Clinic main campus. So, if you have an appointment with your cardiologist or nutritionist or whatever, you may as well stop by for some lunchtime fried perch and peach cobbler after your appointment.","useful":0,"user_id":"nNtI1xRXcZs5R3sBEa8xqw"}

You have to try it if you get the chance. No wonder it's a signature Cleveland food. \n\nI did do the drive thru (after reading other reviews this white girl didn't want to risk going inside by herself late on a Saturday night) but didn't have any issue with a long wait - maybe 3 minutes tops.

The decor of Hot Sauce Williams doesn't look like it's been updated since the 80's-esque crime drama either. \n\nYeah, I get it. Bourdain went here. An episode of Man vs. Food was shot here. East 79th & Carnegie has never seen so many white foodsters flocking here because their favorite TV-foodie says it was good. It's an institution to some. Criticizing it would be akin to criticizing your Mom. Despite all of that, I will still go on record as to saying that Cleveland STILL doesn't do good BBQ. At least no public place that I've found yet does. \n\nHot Sauce Williams is kind of overwhelming. A lot of locals seem to come here. They know what they want even before they arrive. As you enter, a line forms, similar to that of a fast food counter. Place your order, pay, wait for the already prepared food in chaffing dishes to be sauced and packaged and eat it either in the dining room or take it to-go. But wait; there's no menu on the wall! Luckily I found a stack of paper in the dining room that resembled a menu. In no specific order or fashion, the piece of paper spouts off an assortment of food offerings and prices. A different piece of paper that's plastered to the wall says something about substituting sides will cost an additional 85-cents. \n\nThe typical dinner will include fried chicken\/ribs\/pork.etc, a side of slaw, fries and bread. I ordered the chicken dinner. The slaw looked way too liquidy for my tastes, so I upgraded to the mac & cheese. The chicken, smothered in hot sauce was bland, un-crispy and tasted like it was sitting around for a while. The fries were packaged frozen cottage fries (not fresh cut) with their signature sauce dumped on top. The mac and cheese was overcooked and so tender, it almost melts in your mouth. I'm not sure pasta should dissolve like that. They were unfortunately out of cornbread when we went, so we got slices of Wonder bread to go along with our meal. The whole dinner, packaged in a Styrofoam to-go box had to be rubber-banded together because it was overflowing with food. \n\nThe meal was good in a sloppy, messy, down-and-dirty kind of way I guess. That's the way most BBQ is meant to be eaten I suppose. I was just completely underwhelmed by the whole thing. I do BBQ at home in the summer. I have a wood burning smoker where I smoke meats of all varieties. I make cornbread in my cast iron skillet. I love greens and mac and cheese. Needless to say, I've had much better at home and with not much effort.

I would base ratings on overall experiences. This place falls well short of service and decor excellence so you have to be prepared for that when coming here. The location is also not ideal. By that I mean it's not located in the best neighborhood. \n\nNow, with that being said, the food definitely makes up for it. And whether you're a Clevelander or here shortly from out of town, this institution is worth a visit. \n\nWe ordered the Polish Girl, 3 piece chicken dinner, Mac and cheese and greens. First, I'll start with the chicken, and quite simply the BEST I've had. You will find yourself breaking off pieces of that super crispy and delicious skin and dipping in their signature sauce (which should replace ketchup everywhere!) If you're like me and tend to stay away from pieces of white meat with the fear it will be too dry, fear not, the white meat pieces are just as tender as the dark pieces which is always a good sign of perfectly fried chicken. \n\nNow the Polish Girl. Wow ok. You will keep your hands clean because this is a fork meal. This is a spectacle of meat-in-tube form. A kielbasa covered with pork shoulder, topped with fries and that sauce! If your that crazy, get the slaw on top of that! The beauty of this tangy sauce they make is that it an pretty much go on everything. \n\nThe mac n cheese was so-so, but I'll never eat fried chicken without it. The greens are epic. Even if you don't really like greens or if you've never had them and don't think you'll like them, get them. They're amazing.\n\nThat being said, if you want a kick-ass comfort, stick-to-your-ribs meal and want to throw everything you know about dieting out the window and you can look past the horrific pink and blue, dated and a little grimes decor and don't really give a hoot about service as long as they bring you the glory that is being made in the kitchen, this place is a MUST!","useful":0,"user_id":"d6VGtpQ4216ZUuZsQUI9jQ"}

I have never had a single item I did not love from Hotsauce Williams. While the quality of some of the food isn't top notch, it TASTES amazing. The fries seem like they're frozen, but when they're drenched in the house BBQ sauce they taste great. The slaw is absolutely delicious, and I don't even like coleslaw. All the meats are delicious as well. What it really comes down to is the fact that everything is smothered in their BBQ sauce, which is delicious. I give the food itself a 4 out of 5.\n\nThe service: the staff is sometimes very apathetic and slightly rude. There's a lot of young people working there, maybe relatives of the owner, I can't say, that don't really seem to care about their job or whether or not they're giving you good service. I have heard many people complain about the staff there, though I've never personally had a problem with them. The demeanor of some of the younger workers is a little off-putting. I understand it's probably just a part time gig for them while they attend school or something, but it's good to have at least a decently positive attitude at work, especially when dealing with customers. This is balanced only by the owners friendly and happy personality. Every time I've seen him there he always asks me how I'm doing and makes a point to come over to my table and ask how the food is. I give the service a 3 out of 5.\n\nThe atmosphere: honestly this is not the cleanest place around, by any means. The place looks a little old and run down, which gives it a sort of mom and pop shop feel I suppose, but you would think they would put a little money into updating the building\/decor a little bit. The place is sometimes packed, sometimes completely empty. They give you enough space for seating and the lighting is sufficient so that's a good thing. I give the atmosphere a 3 out of 5.\n\nOverall I rate Hotsauce Williams at a 3.3 out of 5. This is not the place you go when you expect a five star meal where someone is gonna car park your car for you and give you a foot rub after you finish your slaw and fries. Not at all. This place is more about the food and for that reason I'll definitely be back again. I would recommend this restaurant to someone who really enjoys BBQ food and isn't too picky about service or atmosphere. Needless to say whether you're a native to Cleveland or the Greater Cleveland area, or whether you're just visiting from out of town you definitely have to check this place out at least once!","useful":1,"user_id":"hbuyoFMC5UbxWIxVHYipwA"}

You're going to be lucky if the staff doesn't actively mock you before shoving the food across a sticky counter in your general direction.  \n\nThus, there is but one reason to come here: the food.  \n\nAs you can see from my quintuple-star review, that food is reason enough.  \n\nCleveland is superior to Detroit in many ways, but Detroit generally whups us when it comes to good, stick-to-your-ribs soul food.  Thankfully, this will do quite nicely.  \n\nThe fried chicken is amazing - a light, crispy crust that's so tasty you could strip it off and eat it on its own, the chicken cooked to a juicy perfection.  The ribs are a little tough - though that's a style issue, they make them that way on purpose because some folks like chewy ribs (I prefer fall-off-the-bone), and there's not a lot of bark on 'em.  \n\nFortunately, they will ask you at the counter: \"You want the sauce?\"  Hell yes you want the sauce,  Peppery without being blatantly hot, flavorful, why the hell did you come to HOT SAUCE WILLIAMS if you don't want the sauce?   Might as well go to Six Flags America and not buy a flag.  \n\nAnyway, the mac and cheese is soft but flavorful (no broiled crust, alas, which would bring it to perfection) and sticky with real cheese.  The mashed potatoes are saturated with butter, and a little chunky.  The candied yams are a little dry - I won't lie - but still nice enough to gobble through. \n\nAnd it's cheap.  $9.99 will get you enough to last you through lunch and dinner.  \n\nIf you're looking for haute cuisine, well, maybe the hideous pink building should have warned you off.  You come here as a food ninja - you sneak in, snatch the chicken from the master's hand, and get the hell out with a full belly.  It works.","useful":5,"user_id":"a1x5xhZ2zpBdOfqtH9x-Kg"}

I didn't think I could eat the entire thing when I saw it- it was huge! But I loved it so much I engulfed it entirely! The sauce is the best. I had to actually go back in and get more sauce to go. \n\nTheir fried chicken looked incredible so I HAD to try it- I just ordered three wings in order to see how it was. The breading on the outside of the wings was incredible- they weren't too crunchy and almost tasted beer battered.. Amazing. \n\nWe had awesome customer service- everyone was helpful and friendly. \n\nI read some reviews and saw that some people were afraid to eat here and suggested drive thru... I guess that depends on when you go. I went on a Sunday afternoon, it was packed so we couldn't eat in the restaurant- but I would have gladly. There weren't any sketchy characters at all, everyone was friendly. There are sketchy people no matter where you go , so don't let any negative reviews like that turn you away from this place! I loved everything about it!","useful":5,"user_id":"DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw"}

I'm a \"food tourist\" and found out about HSW from Man vs Food.\n\nWhat I loved: the Polish Boy!!!!! OMG that was sooooo good.  The fries, coleslaw, and their unique bbq sauce just work with the polish sausage to create a one-of-a-kind taste treat sensation in your mouth!  It was so ridiculously good I talked some business colleagues into going back with me a few days later and they were pretty impressed.  One of them had the fried chicken (with their signature sauce on top) and he said it was damned good.  I also tried some of their ribs which were okay -- I was expecting better considering this is a bbq\/soul food joint but they weren't as tender as I expected.  That said, they weren't bad.  On my second trip, I tried the Polish Girl (which is the Polish Boy plus pulled pork on top of everything else); I was surprised but I preferred the Polish Boy over the Polish Girl. It's not that the pulled pork is bad --- it's great --- but it's one too many flavors in my mouth at once.  It wasn't bad but it just wasn't necessary.\n\nWhat was so-so: the decoration and atmosphere is that of a run down old restaurant.  That said....WHO CARES???  I come for the food, not the decorations.  You want decorations? Go to the Cheesecake Factory.  It's a dive but it's reasonably clean and it wasn't that bad.  The neighborhood isn't great but I went during the daytime (by bus, no less) and felt reasonably safe.  Nobody gave me the 'evil eye' even though it was pretty obvious I was \"not from around here.\"\n\nThe service: the people behind the counter weren't all smiles and energy but they got the job done and the food tasted good. Before going there, I read all the Yelp reviews and a lot of people are trashing the employees and their attitude.  Again, it's NOT the Cheesecake Factory with some chirpy employee who acts like your meal is their mission in life.  These people would probably rather be somewhere else.  But I wasn't ignored, they were reasonably courteous (again, it was VERY clear I was a tourist from out of town), and the food was prepared in a reasonable amount of time, done cleanly, and it tasted great.  If Cheesecake Factory level service is super important to you, you won't enjoy this place.\n\nIn short, come for the food, not the decorations and the service (which isn't that bad, just don't expect to be treated like a god).  If I ever have another trip to Cleveland, I am going to HSW again.\n\nPS They do sell the bbq sauce in bottles and I brought a few home to try and recreate the Polish Boy.","useful":0,"user_id":"wl2gOEQqgj_IJBzOHQoJXQ"}

It is the epitome of southern fried chicken. The coleslaw is great and creamy. Fries are your standard crinkle cut fries but great to dip in their sauce.  I am also a fan of the polish girl and polish boy (Cleveland staple). I like the sauce but their ribs are a little fatty and not meaty, therefore I personally don't order the ribs. So that is the food. Now the atmosphere is not that great but you can't expect a fancy atmosphere and as long as you know what to expect in the neighborhood then you are fine. Now the service is another story. Expect an attitude, rude servers and someone who is just downright annoyed that you are bothering them by making them have to work by preparing your order.   They also run out of food and no matter what time it is they won't be making any more because once again it's too much work. I therefore have to call to make sure they have certain types of  food like chicken breasts before I come as I live 30 minutes away and can't tell you how many times I made the drive and was told they are out of white meat and don't plan to make anymore. They also close early if they don't feel like being open anymore. I actually had them turn the lights and drive through system off on me when I drive up an hour or two before their official closing time. So to sum up, the food is great, service is horrible so if you go in expecting someone to not like you to get some great BBQ then you will be happy.","useful":0,"user_id":"5RLOLqj8f0MMJ5OJVXTeYQ"}

I couldn't NOT have ribs at HSW. It came with 2 sides. I chose collard greens (of course) and cole slaw. My brother and I also split a pork shoulder sandwich (cuz we're fatties). Yep, the one that was featured on No Reservations. Everything was very tasty. The fried chicken was the best I'd ever had. I can't say I've actually eaten that type of fried chicken many places before but it was so effing good that I wanted to make out with it. \n\nMy only complaint with HSW was the girl working the register. She could have been more polite, maybe even a tiny bit personable, or perhaps ... I dunno....helpful? and not a complete bitch? We were almost afraid of her. \n\nI'll be back for sure. I just hope the Trunchbull isn't working.","useful":9,"user_id":"WL_U3MBUfTkeHL9lYxoleg"}

I had the ribs, coleslaw, and french fries, all drizzled with the mild bbq sauce. As you might expect, this was a generous portion of smoky ribs and I did not even come close to finishing the meal. This was fine with me, because now I have leftovers for lunch! The rib dinner, combined with a Pepsi, totaled approximately $10. My friend purchased the chicken dinner (fried chicken) with mac and chees subbed for the coleslaw. Substitutions are a slight up-charge, but it seems worth it to me for home-style mac and cheese. She chose to have her bbq on the side. You must request this, otherwise that ladle of sauce drops on the fries and all. The three of our meals totaled around $30, and if I could make one suggestion to anyone reading this, it would be to try the \"family meal\" which seems to include an insane amount of food (I guess enough to feed a family) at only $28. It is probably a good thing that the 3 of us chose not to share the \"family meal\" as I don't think any of us need that much mac and cheese, ribs, and fried chicken! I was going to suggest that anyone thinking of ordering food for the first time visit the Hot Sauce Williams website but as I write this entry, their website does not seem to be active. Ordering may be a little confusing for a first time customer stepping up to the register as their menu is not clearly visible. However, if you come armed with the information I have given you, you should be all set. Get the family meal if you are ordering for a group ($28? Why not!). And if it is just for you, try the chicken dinner, coleslaw, and mac and cheese (slight up charge for the mac and cheese) with sauce on the side for approximately $10. Enjoy!","useful":2,"user_id":"H_-K6erSJYtzg3ZEvOg3EQ"}

The prices aren't bad and the selection is your standard, when it comes to a soul food spot. I ordered the 2 piece fried chicken meal, with sauce on the side (because I'm not the biggest fan of spicy). The chicken almost feels as though it was made tempura style, the crunch is very different but very good at the same time. The fries are your traditional crinkled cut, no standout seasonings were detected. I am not a fan of cole slaw so I donated mine to the trash can (seeing as though you cannot substitute sides). When I asked how much the can sodas were, the cashier replied \"man these suckers are expensive $1.50 a can.\" Being that I am a punk when it comes to spicy foods I had to purchase one. I was pleased to learn that the sauce isn't all that spicy and I could tolerate it with the help of the expensive soda. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Cleveland. Fried Chicken 1-5=5.

It took them almost 25 minutes to make my food. So for 25 minutes I had a good long look at their heat lamps. I watched several flies and fruit flies land, fly around, and then re-land on the coleslaw and fries. Needlessness when my food actually did come up, I was in no hurry to eat either of those two sides I had gotten. I will admit that the catfish itself was tasty, but the atmosphere completely took my appetite away. The one garbage can in the dining area was overflowing with food bits and dozens of fruit flies, so when we decided to leave (about 5 minutes after my food came), I had to take mine to go, but then my friends had to just set their garbage next to the overflowing trashcan because there were no employees in sight.

As mentioned by another reviewer, generally if you have been to one, you have been to them all. I don't mean it as a bad thing - I like to know what I am getting especially if I am traveling and need a quick 'sure thing' dinner, especially with kids. \nWe were staying just down the street from this Denny's this past Friday (7\/27\/13). They were clearly short staffed. It was not very crowded but we had to wait a while to get seated, get our orders in, and then to get the food. It did fill up by the time we left, which I am surprised about given how the meal tasted.\n\nThe food was atrocious, I mean borderline rancid. None of us could finish our food  and several of us are the types who always clean our plates. The salad appeared to have been sitting around for days, the soup smelled rotten. The oatmeal must have been made by somebody who is not familiar with what oatmeal is, because it looked as though the person poured the dry oatmeal into a bowl, then put half of the usual amount of liquid and then served it. It looked like granola, it was so dry. When we asked about it, the server said, 'I didn't cook it.' Even the pancakes were bad, rubbery and old-tasting.  I honestly don't know how you could screw the meal up worse than it was. It was as if they took outdated food, then had somebody who didn't know how to cook make it. I ordered a wrap with avocado and I don't think there was more than one sliver of avocado, though maybe I should be grateful because it was probably old too.\n\nDenny's should be ashamed that this franchise uses their name. We all know that Denny's isn't high cuisine but you should expect a minimum level of quality from a national chain. This place is terrible.

Such a peculiar name, just had to try it. Brought the family. Cute and colorful little place designed and laid-out with Moroccan-themed decor. Our server, who was awesome, started us off with some bread. Not sure what kind it was - never had it before - but it was semi-flat, grainy\/wheaty with a denser consistency. I didn't care for it much and it didn't help that they didn't serve it with any butter or olive oil. We also got their Mediterranean salad. It came with a good mix of greens, tomatoes, olives, feta. It was good, but the dressing was a little on the sour side for my taste. Onto the entree. As a first-timer here, I ordered the kefta platter, which is my favorite item to order in MME restaurants. Got 4 medallions of kefta with rice, roasted eggplants, green peppers and tomatoes. The veggies were good, but the kefta was a bit underwhelming. They were dry and though spicy, they lacked more seasoning. It was the first time I've had kefta that was spicy - perhaps the Moroccan version? Another downfall for me was they had no offerings for kids. Ended up getting the kefta sandwiches for the kids as I thought it would be the closest thing to a hamburger... not knowing they were spicy, the kids didn't care for them. Plus their sandwich is \"deconstructed\" and served with the same bread when we first sat down. As it was a flatter bread (not pita that you can use as a wrap) we were having trouble figuring out how to fit the meat into the bread, so I just cut a pocket into it with a knife and tried our best to make it a sandwich.\n\nWe came in around 5:30PM and there were only two couples dining in at the time, but it quickly filled up to capacity by the time we got our meal. Our server was by herself and she did the best she could to accommodate everyone while still having a smile on her face and a great attitude.\n\nThough the menu is pretty modest (which I prefer most times), they have some other offerings that I'd like to come back and try. Aside from the kefta that I had on this visit, they also offer beef and chicken kabobs, tagine and other daily specials.\n\nThis visit didn't blow me out of the water, but am curious enough to try other dishes on the menu to come back.","useful":1,"user_id":"4U628IMVQaGuy1wuhy4BNQ"}

MoMo's is a perfect example of that cultural diversity - a small, cozy restaurant owned by a Moroccan that has distinctive decor and serenades you with Moroccan music. It's the closest you could get to Morocco without a passport and plane ticket!\n\nThe interior was clean, with bright colors and painting on the wall that provided a warm, exciting atmosphere. There were small tables and chairs available, as well as two bigger wooden tables that sat lower to the ground and used a comfy looking sofa and squishy chairs as seating. \n\nThe food was amazing! My wife got the grilled beef kebab plate and I went with the lamb kebab plate. They both came with veggies, basmati rice, a side of hot sauce that's made in house, and a Mediterranean salad (which I substituted for a soup that mostly constituted of lentils and chickpeas); we also received a small basket of Moroccan bread. \n\nIt's well documented that we Americans treat eating as a chore but to other cultures it's a social event in and of itself - the food at MoMo's brought a whole new attitude to eating for us. The food was good, but not overly rich - we found ourselves taking smaller bites, talking more throughout our meal, and focusing on how good the food made us feel. It was an amazing change from the way we normally eat, and was only made possible by the combination of atmosphere and food at MoMo's.\n\nThe tea was amazing as well - I'm normally not a fan of mint or green tea, but the way the mint green tea here is prepared makes me a fan! The tea is sweetened and the best way I can  describe it is a slightly sweeter taste than spearmint gum. The way it's served is an experience as well. \n\nThe staff was great too - the host\/server was nice and open to questions about everything. The chef was incredibly kind and enjoyable to talk too - and also wanted to make sure your questions were answered (ask how the tea is made - it's a process that will make it even more incredible to you). One thing that struck me was that the chef carries your plates out to you and serves them you,so everyone gets to meet who cooked the meal. \n\nThis place exceeded all of our expectations and I highly recommend it to everyone!","useful":1,"user_id":"eR8fBtTjtFDuEwhxEYlEeg"}

The room was clean, with a Mediterranean ambiance, and we were soon greeted by the owner, who I believe makes all of the food as well! There is a story about his travels and his passion for cooking on the menu. We could tell this man puts his heart and soul into his food and his restaurant and takes great pride in his work. Of course, with this approach to cooking, the food was absolutely incredible. Freshly prepared warm whole wheat bread was brought to the table. Everything on the menu looked great so we ordered a little of everything. We both ordered one of the two soup options. I don't remember what it was called, but it had lots of lentils and vegetables. It was very nice, perfect portion, perfect temperature, and flavorful. We both ordered beef kebab and received a side salad with the order. All of the vegetables in the salad were very crisp and fresh. The dressing was homemade. For a complimentary salad that came with our meal, this went above and beyond. Now let me rave about the beef kebabs! They were really wonderful as well! The meat was tender, juicy, not tough or dry as in some Mediterranean restaurants. It was a little spicy, which I enjoyed. It came with rice, grilled vegetables, and salsa. It was a perfect portion with beautiful presentation and excellent flavors. Also, we really loved the hot green tea! We both shared one pot.

The gentleman working there was very friendly but the food was really oily and bland. I had the lamb and my wife had the grilled vegetable platter. Both were under seasoned and too greasy. The tabouli was really good tho and the fresh bread was good, although very crunchy. We'll prob try it again but were a bit disappointed with our visit.","useful":0,"user_id":"vZMNPjs8K6ez-OLrFsjisw"}

The cuisine is Moroccan, and for us, was served by the chef himself in a friendly, welcoming way. \n\nThe kebab is amazing; flavorful, simple and tasty, with wonderful rice and grilled vegetables that will make mouths WATER. (I especially loved the eggplant, and my wife, who is not always a veggie fan, loved every bit.) All of the platter meals are served with hot half-loaves of a tasty grain bread, and side salads festooned with olives and a wonderful lemon vinaigrette. \n\nThe drink menu is mostly only water, but if you get a chance, here's a tip; order the green mint tea. Served in a long-pour Moroccan style,(by the owner himself.) It's tasty, soothing, sweet and minty. My wife and I agreed next time, we get TWO pots! \n\nTo top it off, we got some of the house cookies, which are classic stuff; nutty, tasty and really a great way to finish off the meal. \n\nParking here is a bit sparse, but there's a great parking garage behind the building (city run) that's very safe and not too expensive at all. \n\nSo, if you're looking for a treat and want something authentic and well done, try this little place on Lee Road. To sum up, I can only say this; when it comes to Kebab, MAKE MINE MOMO'S !!","useful":2,"user_id":"3lil3eH4skNVzI0y3vM72w"}

We ordered the harira, tabouleh, lamb platter, and lamb tagging special. Everything was delicious, tasted homemade, fresh, and perfectly seasoned. We were started on a complementary salad - what a pleasant surprise! Perfectly seasoned with good quality olive oil and lemon juice, I love the peppery bite of the radish and tanginess of feta cheese. The tabouleh tasted super fresh and really opened up our appetite. The harira, though also delicious, was probably the least outstanding dish of the night. \n\nNow onto the main courses - the lamb platter came with 2 lamb loin chops, grilled veggies, and saffron rice. The lamb was grilled to a perfect medium rare, tender and flavorful with fresh herbs. The saffron rice was fluffy and cooked perfected. The grilled veggies was great - I especially love the undertone of good olive oil in them. It came with a dollop of harissa - it had a nice kick and complemented the lamb perfectly. \n\nThe lamb tagine was also outstanding. The meat was tender and the potatoes and carrots soaked up all the delicious meat flavor. I used the bread to dip into and mop up the sauce. The only critique I have was the portion of the tagine dish was quite small. \n\nI would definitely come back and can't wait to try all their dishes!","useful":0,"user_id":"XvEOKQ0DcM1CkRPYA_3GJg"}

The vegan couscous had a great spice to it. The tabouli is very fresh and tastes strongly of lemon. The green salads come with a lot of dressing. The chicken kebab was dry. All of it comes with a dense round wheat bread. If we give the place another try we will wait until fall. The air conditioning is very weak so it was hotter inside than outside (on a 90 degree day). Ask for ice in your water on the hot days!","useful":0,"user_id":"W4fQ5Eay71kAUW0cTMjehw"}
