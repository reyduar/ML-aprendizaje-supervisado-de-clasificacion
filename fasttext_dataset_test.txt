__label__4 decor and service leave much to be desired ,  but the food is worthy of 4 . 5 stars .  i ' ve eaten at both locations several times now over the past year ,  since moving from san diego ,  and i think the food is very good .   the fried chicken and polish boy in particular are awesome .   the ribs are just average .  good sauce ,  but not super tender and have not been smoked enough for my taste . 
__label__2 don ' t believe the hype .  nooooo !    in the cleveland area ,  there ' s an endless supply of small ,  unique eateries that take the time to create and serve unique ,  tasteful ,  hand-crafted items with flavor .  hot sauce williams has created a great commodity in his bbq sauce ,  however ,  ruins the spirit of cleveland goodies by serving it over generic ,  tasteless ,  frozen bag items .    granted ,  my review is based off a polish boy sandwich combo .  i haven ' t tried anything else and after trying the combo ,  i most likely won ' t make my way back to try anything else .    g love sang about it ,  so it can ' t be that bad ,  can it ?  can the creator of such gems as  ' cold beverages '  and  ' milk and cereal '  really steer me in the wrong direction ?  he did ,  however ,  i ' ll forgive him with a listening of  ' baby ' s got sauce '   ( pun intended ?  )  .    the fries are actually store-bought ore-ida brand fries .  i can remember being served those with dinner when i was a lad in the late 1980s .  they are perfectly tasteless .  the sauce drenches over them ,  adding taste ,  but it just seems incredibly lazy to take something i can easily buy in the store ,  increase the price ,  and serve it to customers .     the buns are of exactly the same nature - walk in to any grocery store and purchase the cheapest hot dog buns they have - you ' d be getting exactly what is served .    the sausage wasn ' t bad ,  had some taste and was of average size  ( i ' d throw in a  ' that ' s what she said ,  '  but that phrase is so overused ,  i ' ll let it be )  .    it isn ' t terrible ,  but to be honest ,  without the sauce ,  there ' s no way hot sauce williams would still be in business after all these years .  the cute nickname helps ,  i ' m guessing .  i ' m guessing a lot of people wouldn ' t keep returning to a "mr .  williams barbecue restaurant" - so i guess the gimmick is working .  plus ,  it ' d be totally cool of williams decided to sponsor a mma fighter ,  just so there ' d be a fighter with the  ' hot sauce '  nickname .    the service is ,  well ,  non-existent .  i asked for  ' slaw on the side ,  and when i received my meal ,  my  ' slaw was in the middle ,  which made the bun and accompanying fries soggy on the center and sides - they fell apart upon contact .  the  ' slaw is mostly liquid .  i was reduced to eating a weird liquid mixture of ore-ida fries ,  juicy  ' slaw ,  bbq sauce and bread .    sort of weird ,  they also give out cans of soda instead of fountain drinks .    i ' d buy a bottle of the sauce and use that at home ,  but i really wouldn ' t suggest eating here unless you ' re interested in a bland ,  sloppy mess of stuff you can grab at the nearest piggly wiggly  ( which ,  for northerners ,  is probably pretty far away ,  so i ' d have no clue why you ' d travel that far to grab those simple ingredients )  . 
__label__1 the location on 79th carnegie ,  is a hot ghetto mess .  i am ashamed of what the establishment has turned into .  maybe i ' ll try out superior or lee rd . 
__label__4 best fried chicken out there .  skip the hot sauce ,  it isn ' t hot ,  and is frankly pretty disgusting .  the various sides on offer are mediocre .  there is a high likelihood of there being no food in the restaurant ,  especially later in the day ,  so call before going .  seems like it ' s takeout only in spite of having a large restaurant space . 
__label__4 despite being slathered in their sauce ,  this fried chicken surprisingly maintains its crispiness and isn ' t the least bit overpowered by the flavors of the sauce .  actually ,  the sauce compliments the chicken so well that it had me asking for more- i even bought a bottle of their original sauce for the road since we were just visiting cleveland .  of the two sides that were ordered ,  the mac n cheese tastes similar to a homemade baked dish packed with cheesy goodness .  the fried okra was decent ,  but was coated in so much batter that i could barely taste the okra .  in addition to the good food ,  the service is also worth mentioning- everyone behind the counter was hospitable and made for a great first visit to hot sauce williams
__label__5 hot sauce williams is amazing ,  but it is certainly not a place to go for a low calorie meal .  fried chicken ,  st .  louis style ribs ,  mac n cheese ,  sweet potato pie ,  etc .  it ' s all awesome .  the fried chicken is done perfectly !  my mouth waters just thinking of this place .  its a simple place ,  you order from a counter and can either take your food to go or eat it there .  all that matters is the food is killer ! 
__label__4 hot sauce williams takes the best bbq in cleveland in my option .  the home made mac and cheese is astonishing .  the chicken is drenched in sauce and you just have to saver the flavor .  i love to lick my fingers clean to finish off my meal . 
__label__3 painful to watch this slow disorganized mess try to handle just a few orders at once .  took 30 minutes to get our food and that was because we accepted other chicken pieces than what we ordered because they said it would take longer .  short story long: if you ' re in a hurry this isn ' t the place for you .   on a positive note; the ribs were very good even with a little too much of their hot sauce on them .  but the ribs weren ' t incredibly meaty .  the chicken was nicely fried ,  but they put a bit too much hot sauce on it .  the fries and mac and cheese were good with the hot sauce .    an odd mix resulting in a 3 star experience
__label__3 this is a funny place .   being from youngstown ,  and not cleveland ,  i went here after my cleveland clinic appointment ,  because i saw this place on man vs food .   i went there for one reason only .  .  . the polish boy .   the service staff was really under-enthused to wait on me .  .  . even though i was only 1 of 4 people in the whole joint .   the 1st lady who i said hi to pointed me in the direction of the stack of paper menus ,  without saying anything back to me .     the polish boy ,  was not on it .   but after asking the lady at the counter ,  they do still have it available .   it ' s a kielbasa on a bun ,  topped with fries ,  coleslaw ,  and bbq sauce .   the tv show also added pork shoulder to the sandwich ,  but for some reason ,  they didn ' t put it on mine .   it was awesome nonetheless .     the place was a dive ,  doesn ' t look that clean ,  and it ' s located in a not-so-great side of town ,  and the service was lacking any personality .   however ,  the polish boy was great .   i would definitely have this again .   i hear their other food is good too ,  but the pb is all i wanted .   3 stars for the food .   0 stars for the service .   letter grade:  b
__label__4 hot sauce williams is definitely a guilty pleasure of mine : )  my favorite dish from here is the fried chicken and ribs dinner .  for sides ,  i get the sweet potato fries and mac and cheese .  they give you sooooo much food for just under $12 !    the servers work only behind the food stand ,  so you pretty much have to clean off the tables yourself .  you may at first be deterred from this place by its lack of cleanliness ,  but the food is so worth it !   one thing to keep in mind ,  they don ' t provide free water ,  but a bottle of water is only $1 .    definitely worth checking out ! 
__label__5 let me just apologize to the food gods right now for having taken 20 years of my life to finally try this hometown legend .    i had heard that their fried chicken was possibly the most delicious thing that could ever touch your lips but my god .  .  .  .  i ' m speechless .  i ' ve had so much amazing fried chicken i can ' t even think ,  but hot sauce william ' s was so far above anything i ' ve ever tasted .  it had the perfect crisp yet the chicken was moist n juicy n the breading was heavenly not to mention his signature hot sauce was sooooo &@* ! %# delicious it isn ' t even funny .  i had the 3 piece dinner special for about $9 to go and some is still left in my fridge eagerly awaiting tomorrow morning .  leftovers have never sounded so good !   two huge thumbs up !  i ' ll be back next week !  !  ! 
__label__3 so i was really interested in this place because of the man vs food and other foodie reviews and publicity .   to say that its in an interesting section of town is an understatement .   the location is a bit rundown and the interior might need a good scrubbing .   when i came in at 1245p ,  there was no fried chicken ready ,  no greens and it didn ' t seem that they were ready to serve customers for lunch .   the place was pretty empty though .   i asked if they had any chicken and it was 6 minutes until it was done .   i ' d wait .   ordered the two piece and mac / cheese and cole slaw .   total for that was about $10 .   food arrived .  .  .  no frills .   cole slaw was darned good ,  wished there was more .   mac & cheese was nothing special .   chicken was great .   not especially tasty flour coating ,  but the chicken itself was perfectly done .   not 1 degree too little ,  not 1 degree too much .   melts in the mouth .   for the food ,  i ' d give it a 3 . 5 stars .   the decor gets one star .   but food trumps decor .  .  . 
__label__1 never tasted a worse barbecue sauce anywhere .   i got the signature ribs and sauce ,  with fries ,  & slaw .   the sauce had a tang to it that i should have recognized as spoiled ,  and the ribs were dry .   and to make matters worse ,  all of my fries were covered in the sauce ?   our waitress was very nice and helped guide us through the menu .   however ,  the food and cleanliness was substandard for a supposed cleveland icon ,  or any eatery for that matter .  lots of fruit flies and the itsy-bitsy spider enjoyed watching us eat from our window sill . 
__label__5 mo was the manager / server .   she was excellent .   i was visiting my hometown and had to take my other non-locals here to experience the beef polish boy .   i ordered the perch dinner with double fries .  .  .  . gotta have the sauce on the fries .   it was excellent ,  as always .   great crust to the perch .   a lot of fish for 8 . 95 .     we were treated to desserts ,  such as sweet potato  pies .  .  .  .  . homemade pies ,  not that frozen mess .   i couldn ' t eat all of my food .   really nice sized order .   the bbq sauce is the best .  .  .  .  . but the packets of hot sauce are no good .   stick with their homemade  ,  signature sauce . 
__label__2 not impressed  .  .  .  i got the 3 piece chicken dinner with green beans and coleslaw .  the coleslaw was cool ?  green beans were bland ,  the chicken was cooked perfect very juicy and crispy but that ' s where it ends .  .  .  i got the sauce because if the reviews .  .  .  i ' m still waiting to see what the fuss was about .  .  .  maybe it was the location ,  maybe the other locations are better .  i will not be a return customer .  i wish i would have gotten the po boy .  oh well i ' ll never know what it taste like because i just don ' t understand the hype . 
__label__3 i love their fried chicken with their house made hot sauce on it .  it is the epitome of southern fried chicken .  the coleslaw is great and creamy .  fries are your standard crinkle cut fries but great to dip in their sauce .   i am also a fan of the polish girl and polish boy  ( cleveland staple )  .  i like the sauce but their ribs are a little fatty and not meaty ,  therefore i personally don ' t order the ribs .  so that is the food .  now the atmosphere is not that great but you can ' t expect a fancy atmosphere and as long as you know what to expect in the neighborhood then you are fine .  now the service is another story .  expect an attitude ,  rude servers and someone who is just downright annoyed that you are bothering them by making them have to work by preparing your order .    they also run out of food and no matter what time it is they won ' t be making any more because once again it ' s too much work .  i therefore have to call to make sure they have certain types of  food like chicken breasts before i come as i live 30 minutes away and can ' t tell you how many times i made the drive and was told they are out of white meat and don ' t plan to make anymore .  they also close early if they don ' t feel like being open anymore .  i actually had them turn the lights and drive through system off on me when i drive up an hour or two before their official closing time .  so to sum up ,  the food is great ,  service is horrible so if you go in expecting someone to not like you to get some great bbq then you will be happy . 
__label__4 i ' ve driven past this place who knows how many times and between that sparking my curiosity ,  along with my bf taking about how good it is ,  i figured one of these days i need to give this place a go .  well ,  that go happened recently after moving the first batch of boxes into our new place .   between carrying heavy boxes up a steep ,  long flight of stairs and just plain sweating off calories standing in the heat  ( gross ,  i know .   sorry )  ,  i figured i would treat myself to this messy ,  greasy deliciousness .   and now i ' m glad i did .    when we walked inside and i looked at the menu for the first time ,  i was a little overwhelmed - mainly because everything looked so good and i couldn ' t make up my mind on what to order .   but in all seriousness ,  they have quite a few combination platters to choose from ,  so ordering may take some time .   i settled on the fish ,  shrimp ,  and fry combo - the boyfriend went for the chicken ,  rib ,  fry combo .   both were excellent choices .   be sure to work on those biceps before you come here because the boxes of food they give you weigh a ton !   you get a massive amount of food for a great price ,  everything came out fresh and hot ,  and the sauce they pour over everything is amazing .   i was an overly stuffed / sauce all over face girl when we left ,  but it was absolutely worth it .   so don ' t wait as long as i did to get your grub on with some excellent bbq because you need to know what you ' re missing out on .   oh - and fyi - don ' t wear anything nice or white to this place .   and if you have young children you might want to borrow one of their bibs because the eating is quite messy . 
__label__4 first time going there .  a little slow but worth the wait .  we got a polish boy and girl  ( intrigued by the addition of pulled pork on the girl )  .  truth be told ,  we didn ' t want to eat in so we got it to go since it was not super clean but most because there is no air conditioning on .   the guy in front of us ordered a slab of ribs which is alot of meat but said he was working down the road and had never been there .  in fact ,  most of the conversations i heard was that of ppl eating there for the first time .  the sauce is the real deal and will definitely go back to try the fried chicken .  btw ,  the cost of our boy and girl was less than $12 .   it ' s worth it . 
__label__3 superb chicken with service that is a little on the slow side .   hot sauce williams has very good fried chicken .   the pieces are huge and very crispy .   you can have the restaurant ' s famous barbecue sauce on the side or served on the chicken - personally i like the chicken better without the sauce on it .   the ribs are decent ,  but in my opinion the chicken is the winner here .   the only reason i didn ' t give this place 4 stars was that it took quite a while  ( more than 30 minutes )  for me to get my chicken both of the times i came here .   while i appreciated how fresh the chicken was ,  i thought that the new batches of food could have come out more quickly .   also ,  the serving could have been more efficient .   when i have time to wait though and want to buy a large tray of fried chicken for a party ,  this will be the place that i will be going to . 
__label__1 gut rot .  1 / 4 meat ,  1 / 4 fat ,  1 / 2 sauce ,  that pretty much sums up the ribs at hsw .  not the cleanest place i ' ve ever been .  it ' s not good .  .  . at all .  yech ! 
__label__5 i ' m giving them 5 stars for the fried chicken alone .  it is amazing .  it has this super crunchy crust that is totally unlike anything i ' ve ever had on fried chicken before .  it ' s like having your chicken thoroughly egg-battered and then friend crispy .  the result is positively delicious .    i love the ribs too .  they don ' t boil their ribs before cooking them ,  so if you like  ' fall off the bone '  type ribs ,  these are not for you .  these are good ribs to knaw on .  they were also impressively big .   i almost docked them a star for borderline surly service and lack of a / c ,  but at this price  ( $30 for four people +leftovers )  i can hardly complain .  they ' ll have to be much grouchier than that to keep me away from that fried chicken .   things that were great: +mac n cheese +fried chicken +sausage  +bbq sauce  things that were not great: -not terribly friendly  ( to us )  -no diet in the soda machine -greens were only so so -the sausage ends up too soaked in slaw and bbq sauce to actually eat with your hands .  the bun will just fall apart .  -zero ambiance .  they could use the services of a carpenter and a painter .   final note: this review is for the pink location on carnegie and does not apply to the lee rd location ,  which was only mediocre imho . 
__label__3 i have to admit that i am not one to line-up to sample any food described as "spicy" or "hot . " luckily ,  hot sauce williams signature bbq sauce is not spicy as the name originally suggested to me .   i had the ribs ,  coleslaw ,  and french fries ,  all drizzled with the mild bbq sauce .  as you might expect ,  this was a generous portion of smoky ribs and i did not even come close to finishing the meal .  this was fine with me ,  because now i have leftovers for lunch !  the rib dinner ,  combined with a pepsi ,  totaled approximately $10 .  my friend purchased the chicken dinner  ( fried chicken )  with mac and chees subbed for the coleslaw .  substitutions are a slight up-charge ,  but it seems worth it to me for home-style mac and cheese .  she chose to have her bbq on the side .  you must request this ,  otherwise that ladle of sauce drops on the fries and all .  the three of our meals totaled around $30 ,  and if i could make one suggestion to anyone reading this ,  it would be to try the "family meal" which seems to include an insane amount of food  ( i guess enough to feed a family )  at only $28 .  it is probably a good thing that the 3 of us chose not to share the "family meal" as i don ' t think any of us need that much mac and cheese ,  ribs ,  and fried chicken !  i was going to suggest that anyone thinking of ordering food for the first time visit the hot sauce williams website but as i write this entry ,  their website does not seem to be active .  ordering may be a little confusing for a first time customer stepping up to the register as their menu is not clearly visible .  however ,  if you come armed with the information i have given you ,  you should be all set .  get the family meal if you are ordering for a group  ( $28 ?  why not !  )  .  and if it is just for you ,  try the chicken dinner ,  coleslaw ,  and mac and cheese  ( slight up charge for the mac and cheese )  with sauce on the side for approximately $10 .  enjoy ! 
__label__5 we ' ve driven past hot sauce williams any number of times ,  always on our way to some other event ,  always promising that we ' d stop "next time . "  well "next time" finally arrived .  and we are kicking ourselves for taking so long .  the fried chicken was the best i ' ve ever eaten - juicy and tender on the inside ,  crispy on the outside .  the ribs were tasty ,  as was the sauce .  the macaroni and cheese is only beaten by the memory of mac-and-cheese from a sadly defunct soul food restaurant  ( it was so good we called it "crack-aroni and cheese" )  .  the yams and baked beans were also excellent .   the restaurant is counter service ,  with a spacious ,  beaten-up dining room .  considering that the dining rooms in the soul food restaurants where we ate in atlanta consisted of picnic tables and benches ,  the decor seems fitting .  the service was perfunctory ,  but not rude .    in sum ,  delicious food that ' s so bad for you - definitely not daily fare ,  but the choice for soul food here in cleveland . 
__label__1 we decided to grab a quick meal before heading off to the nearby airport .  but i felt the place wasn ' t the cleanliest and our waitress smelled of bad bo ,  that was very noticeable and distracting .  we ordered some omelettes and hash browns and it was quite lacking in flavor .  i know it ' s a chain ,  but i ' ve seen much better . 
__label__1 i ' ve been to this location several times without issues but today i can say i ' ll never return .  first of all ,  the staff is extremely unhygienic looking and also very unprofessional .  we got our table and it was under the air conditioning .  we froze the entire time !  it was only about 60 degrees outside !  !  and to make this experience even more magical ,  we all got our food at separate times ,  by the time the last entree came we wanted to go boxes and to get out of there .  we sat for another 15 minutes waiting for our bill .  not to mention the fact that our server never asked anyone if they needed drink refills ,  just nothing .  it wasn ' t insanely busy ,  there were other staff members walking around .  would never recommend to go here . 
__label__5 food was amazingly complex .  atmosphere was relaxing .  the place was packed on the saturday we visited - and for good reason .   an experience like no other in the cleveland area .  staff was fantastic .  mint tea was perfect .   main course was delicious .    i highly recommend momo ' s - try it and you too will be pleasantly surprised . 
__label__5 delicious beef kebob .  very fresh and well seasoned .  ultra adorable decor too ! 
__label__3 a huge fan of mediterranean / middle eastern  ( mme )  cuisine ,  i was glad to see another one pop up in the heights as another option to anatolia .  such a peculiar name ,  just had to try it .  brought the family .  cute and colorful little place designed and laid-out with moroccan-themed decor .  our server ,  who was awesome ,  started us off with some bread .  not sure what kind it was - never had it before - but it was semi-flat ,  grainy / wheaty with a denser consistency .  i didn ' t care for it much and it didn ' t help that they didn ' t serve it with any butter or olive oil .  we also got their mediterranean salad .  it came with a good mix of greens ,  tomatoes ,  olives ,  feta .  it was good ,  but the dressing was a little on the sour side for my taste .  onto the entree .  as a first-timer here ,  i ordered the kefta platter ,  which is my favorite item to order in mme restaurants .  got 4 medallions of kefta with rice ,  roasted eggplants ,  green peppers and tomatoes .  the veggies were good ,  but the kefta was a bit underwhelming .  they were dry and though spicy ,  they lacked more seasoning .  it was the first time i ' ve had kefta that was spicy - perhaps the moroccan version ?  another downfall for me was they had no offerings for kids .  ended up getting the kefta sandwiches for the kids as i thought it would be the closest thing to a hamburger .  .  .  not knowing they were spicy ,  the kids didn ' t care for them .  plus their sandwich is "deconstructed" and served with the same bread when we first sat down .  as it was a flatter bread  ( not pita that you can use as a wrap )  we were having trouble figuring out how to fit the meat into the bread ,  so i just cut a pocket into it with a knife and tried our best to make it a sandwich .   we came in around 5:30pm and there were only two couples dining in at the time ,  but it quickly filled up to capacity by the time we got our meal .  our server was by herself and she did the best she could to accommodate everyone while still having a smile on her face and a great attitude .   though the menu is pretty modest  ( which i prefer most times )  ,  they have some other offerings that i ' d like to come back and try .  aside from the kefta that i had on this visit ,  they also offer beef and chicken kabobs ,  tagine and other daily specials .   this visit didn ' t blow me out of the water ,  but am curious enough to try other dishes on the menu to come back . 
__label__5 the east side needs more places like this ,  which is why i ' m writing this review ,  hoping that people go and support this guy .  the food is delicious ,  fresh ,  and well-priced .  you can really tell that everything is made from scratch since some of the flavors are really nuanced and unlike those found elsewhere  ( especially the sauces )  .  go there . 
__label__5 i love a personal touch ,  and on top of great food and service ,  this place has just become a favorite of mine .    the menu is small ,  but amazingly well done .  the cuisine is moroccan ,  and for us ,  was served by the chef himself in a friendly ,  welcoming way .    the kebab is amazing; flavorful ,  simple and tasty ,  with wonderful rice and grilled vegetables that will make mouths water .   ( i especially loved the eggplant ,  and my wife ,  who is not always a veggie fan ,  loved every bit .  )  all of the platter meals are served with hot half-loaves of a tasty grain bread ,  and side salads festooned with olives and a wonderful lemon vinaigrette .    the drink menu is mostly only water ,  but if you get a chance ,  here ' s a tip; order the green mint tea .  served in a long-pour moroccan style ,  ( by the owner himself .  )  it ' s tasty ,  soothing ,  sweet and minty .  my wife and i agreed next time ,  we get two pots !    to top it off ,  we got some of the house cookies ,  which are classic stuff; nutty ,  tasty and really a great way to finish off the meal .    parking here is a bit sparse ,  but there ' s a great parking garage behind the building  ( city run )  that ' s very safe and not too expensive at all .    so ,  if you ' re looking for a treat and want something authentic and well done ,  try this little place on lee road .  to sum up ,  i can only say this; when it comes to kebab ,  make mine momo ' s  !  ! 
__label__5 we came on a saturday night and waited a little bit before seated .  we ordered the harira ,  tabouleh ,  lamb platter ,  and lamb tagging special .  everything was delicious ,  tasted homemade ,  fresh ,  and perfectly seasoned .  we were started on a complementary salad - what a pleasant surprise !  perfectly seasoned with good quality olive oil and lemon juice ,  i love the peppery bite of the radish and tanginess of feta cheese .  the tabouleh tasted super fresh and really opened up our appetite .  the harira ,  though also delicious ,  was probably the least outstanding dish of the night .    now onto the main courses - the lamb platter came with 2 lamb loin chops ,  grilled veggies ,  and saffron rice .  the lamb was grilled to a perfect medium rare ,  tender and flavorful with fresh herbs .  the saffron rice was fluffy and cooked perfected .  the grilled veggies was great - i especially love the undertone of good olive oil in them .  it came with a dollop of harissa - it had a nice kick and complemented the lamb perfectly .    the lamb tagine was also outstanding .  the meat was tender and the potatoes and carrots soaked up all the delicious meat flavor .  i used the bread to dip into and mop up the sauce .  the only critique i have was the portion of the tagine dish was quite small .    i would definitely come back and can ' t wait to try all their dishes !
